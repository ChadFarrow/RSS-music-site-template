## API Endpoints

### Album Data
- `GET /api/albums-static-cached` - Cached album data (fast)
- `GET /api/albums-no-db` - Fresh album data (dynamic parsing)
- `GET /api/albums-static` - Static pre-generated album data
- `GET /api/album/[id]` - Single album endpoint with static fallback

### Feed Management
- **RSS Cache Location**: `/data/rss-cache/`
- **Feed Configuration**: `/data/feeds.json` (46 feeds total)
- **Static Data**: `/data/static/albums.json`
- **LNURL Test Data**: Special album for Lightning payment testing

### Helipad Integration (Testing)
- `POST /api/helipad-webhook` - Webhook endpoint for Helipad boost notifications
- `GET /api/helipad-boosts` - Retrieve stored Helipad boosts
- `DELETE /api/helipad-boosts` - Clear Helipad boost storage (testing only)
- `POST /api/test-helipad-webhook` - Test endpoint for webhook simulation

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Albums
If albums are not displaying:
1. Check RSS cache: `ls -la data/rss-cache/`
2. Clear cache: `rm -rf data/rss-cache/*`
3. Test feeds: `npm run test-feeds`
4. Update static data: `./scripts/update-static-data.sh`

### RSS Feed Issues
- **Cache collisions**: Fixed in `lib/rss-cache.ts` - cache keys use full base64 encoding
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Invalid feeds**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Performance
- **Slow loading**: Check CDN configuration and static generation
- **Audio issues**: Verify HLS.js and AudioContext browser support
- **Cache problems**: Clear browser cache and RSS cache directory
- **Payment render loops**: Fixed in January 2025 - payment recipients now use React useMemo

### Lightning Payment Issues
- **Wallet not connecting**: Check Bitcoin Connect status and wallet compatibility
- **Payment failures**: Verify Lightning address validity and node connectivity
- **NWC issues**: Confirm Nostr Wallet Connect string and relay connectivity
- **Missing recipients**: Check album value tags and payment recipient parsing

### Helipad Integration Issues (Testing)
- **Webhook not receiving boosts**: Verify webhook URL and authorization token configuration
- **TOR connectivity**: Ensure Helipad instance can reach public webhook URL (not localhost/ngrok)
- **Platform badges incorrect**: Check boost parsing logic and tag detection
- **Duplicate boosts**: Verify deduplication logic is working correctly
- **Storage resets**: In-memory storage clears on server restart (development only)

## Template Notes

### Taskmaster Files
The `.taskmaster/` directory contains development planning files from the original project. These can be:
- **Kept for reference** - Shows the project's evolution
- **Deleted** - Run `rm -rf .taskmaster/` if you don't need them
- **Replaced** - Initialize new taskmaster for your project with `task-master init`

### Example Data
All example data has been cleared from:
- `public/publishers.json`
- `public/static-albums.json`
- `public/albums-static-cached.json`
- `data/static/albums.json`

These will be populated when you add your own RSS feeds.
